# devserv website

This is a website project that exploits newserv's REST API. This should eventually become the website I'll use on my server project.

## Getting Started

Clone the project, then install all dependencies
```bash
npm i
```

Copy and edit `.env.example` with the desired parameters, then run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```
